Heavy emphasis on responsive design. Spent an evening making sure rescaling
worked smoothly.

Put a lot of care into making sure the site looks good without css, too. This
helps both people with bad internet connections and visually impaired users who
rely on text-to-speech to use websites.

Padding of the section text is a little less on the right to achieve balance,
since there's on average less text on the right end of the lines.

Trying to present the info with simple style. Inspired by nice-looking unstyled
html pages.

Open GitHub, resum√©, and email in separate tabs. Forces people to come back to
my website eventually.

There were a number of minor behavior issues that needed tweaking.
